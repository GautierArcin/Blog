Welcome to my blog!

My name is Gautier Arcin. Robotics engineer by training, I had the chance to work successively in space robotics [(on an ESA project)](https://www.h2020-pulsar.eu/), in machine learning (on a conversational agent named [Linto](https://linto.ai/)) to end up currently on FullStack themes, web & mobile, through which I promote the research work of my team.

This site is a showcase for all my projects, professional but also personal. The articles will be Tech oriented, as I particularly like to share what I've had the chance to learn, but I also plan to publish articles more focused on others subjects, especially on the pernicious effects of technology.

I am always open to new opportunities.
