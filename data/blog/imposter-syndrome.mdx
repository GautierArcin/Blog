Chances are that you might suffer from imposter syndrome, as 9 to 82% of people peoples according to a review of 62 studies. [^1]

## Overcoming imposter syndrome

If you're suffering from imposter syndrome, there's hope ! You can overcome it with some time. 

Here are some things that helped me overcome my own: 


* **Challenge your own beliefs**.  

<div  style={{"paddingLeft":"1.75rem"}}>
Imposter syndrome come with certains core beliefs, like *"I'm only here because of luck"* or *"I'm gonna fail some day, and they'll discover my inadequacy"*. They are just thought, and they might both true and false. Try to examine your successes, failures, and feedback from your superior **with an objective perspective**. Maybe you're lucky, yes, but maybe you're also comptent.

Tools, like [CBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy), can help.
</div>

* **Read about it**.  

<div  style={{"paddingLeft":"1.75rem"}}>
Understanding that it's a widespread psychological phenomen can help put it in perspective. 
</div>

* **Talk about it**.  

<div  style={{"paddingLeft":"1.75rem"}}>
Be it your friends, your co-workers or  your superiors, chances are that, you might know someone that experience(ed) it too. A lot of people experience it in secret.  For example, a friend of mine was also experiencing it to my bewilderment, even though he probably is one of the most skilled engineer I know.
</div>


* **Curb your own exceptations**.

<div  style={{"paddingLeft":"1.75rem"}}>
You won't know everything. You will make mistakes. Both are fine, as long as you continually try to improve yourself. Perfectionism is the most certain way to burnout.
</div>

* **Know your responsabilities**.  

<div  style={{"paddingLeft":"1.75rem"}}>
As long as you didn't lied to get your position, management hired knowing your technical level. Their work is, therefore, to give you task that you can do (within the deadlines they give you).

That means that, If a project is behind schedule, it's probably not (only) your fault:
*	Maybe the time estimation was very optimistic.
*	Maybe some problems arised during developement (using legacy code not architecturally designed for what you want to do now, deprecated libraries, ...) . 
*	Maybe your lead developper got it by a truck and is now in hospital for 2 months. 
*	...

Projects can go wrong for many reasons. Try to identify them and your level of responsability in them.
</div>


* **Try to not compare yourself to others**.  

<div  style={{"paddingLeft":"1.75rem"}}>
Easier said than done, since other are valuable point of comparaison, but they tend to be very biased one. We tend to see what other knows that we don't know, but we don't see the other way around, for example.

</div>

Another example would be a junior member that compars himself to a more experienced member of the team. Sure, you're not as competent, but you cost half as much.

</div>

* **Don't neglect your hobbies**.  

<div  style={{"paddingLeft":"1.75rem"}}>
If you're suffering from imposter syndrome, chance are that you're anxious and you might work more to compensate your (perceived) flaws. That's a very slippery slope to burnout.

Hobbies and exercice are one of the most effective way to prevent burnout. [^5] Keeping a good work-life balance is good for your well-being, but also your productivity. [^6]
