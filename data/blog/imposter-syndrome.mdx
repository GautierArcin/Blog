Have you felt like you don't belong where you worked ? Like you're a fraud, waiting to be exposed, to your co-workers, superiors, or friends ?

Chances are that you might suffer from imposter syndrome, as 9 to 82% of people peoples according to a review of 62 studies. [^1]

## What is "Imposter syndrome" ?

### General definition

T

### Imposter syndrome in tech

A whopping 58% of tech employes experience imposter syndrome, according to a survey done by blind in 2018. [^2]

Multiples reasons might explains it:

- **High salaries**

<div style={{ paddingLeft: '1.75rem' }}>
Earning a lot of money can make you wonder if you really deserve that money.
</div>

- **Fast evolving technologies**

<div  style={{"paddingLeft":"1.75rem"}}>

Technologies, especially in certains domains like web developpement, evolves very fast.

Software engineer have to learn continuously and watch for new emergents technologies. While it's one of the best part of the job (since you're always learning and intellectually stimulated), it can makes you feel somewhat incomptent

- **Being surrounded by brilliant people**

<div  style={{"paddingLeft":"1.75rem"}}>
IQ measurements is a very controversial measure of intelligence, but there are studies that show that average IQ among software developpement is higher than the average. [^3]

</div>

- **Remote work**
<div style={{ paddingLeft: '1.75rem' }}>
Imposter syndrome seems to be way more prevalent in remote worker [^4]. Tech is one of the few sectors that allows for widespread remote work.

### Dunning-Kruger effect

We can't talk about Imposter syndrome without tackling about the Dunning-Kruger effect.

***`The Dunning–Kruger effect is a hypothetical cognitive bias stating that people with low ability at a task overestimate their own ability, and that people with high ability at a task underestimate their own ability.`***
*[Dunning–Kruger effect, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)*

According to the dunning kruger effect, peoples with low abilities don't possess the skills needed to recognize their own incompetence.

</div>

Point is, if you're questionning your own ability, it might be a good sign that you're at least

Therefore, while dunning kruger and imposter syndrome are both problem of perception relative to real ability, one is the polar opposite of the other:

</div>

However, Dunning-kruger effect is a controversial cognitive bias. In fact, some recent studies might indicate that it might be a data artefact. [^aa] Therefore, it should be taken with a grain of salt.

## Overcoming imposter syndrome

If you're suffering from imposter syndrome, there's hope ! You can overcome it with some time.

Here are some things that helped me overcome my own:

- **Challenge your own beliefs**.

<div  style={{"paddingLeft":"1.75rem"}}>
Imposter syndrome come with certains core beliefs, like *"I'm only here because of luck"* or *"I'm gonna fail some day, and they'll discover my inadequacy"*. They are just thought, and they might both true and false. Try to examine your successes, failures, and feedback from your superior **with an objective perspective**. Maybe you're lucky, yes, but maybe you're also comptent.

Tools, like [CBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy), can help.

</div>

- **Read about it**.

<div style={{ paddingLeft: '1.75rem' }}>
Understanding that it's a widespread psychological phenomen can help put it in perspective.
</div>

- **Talk about it**.

<div style={{ paddingLeft: '1.75rem' }}>
Be it your friends, your co-workers or your superiors, chances are that, you might know someone that experience(ed) it too. A lot of people experience it in secret. For example, a friend of mine was also experiencing it to my bewilderment, even though he probably is one of the most skilled engineer I know.
</div>

- **Curb your own exceptations**.

<div style={{ paddingLeft: '1.75rem' }}>
You won't know everything. You will make mistakes. Both are fine, as long as you continually try to improve yourself. Perfectionism is the most certain way to burnout.
</div>

- **Know your responsabilities**.

<div  style={{"paddingLeft":"1.75rem"}}>
As long as you didn't lied to get your position, management hired knowing your technical level. Their work is, therefore, to give you task that you can do (within the deadlines they give you).

That means that, If a project is behind schedule, it's probably not (only) your fault:

- Maybe the time estimation was very optimistic.
- Maybe some problems arised during developement (using legacy code not architecturally designed for what you want to do now, deprecated libraries, ...) .
- Maybe your lead developper got it by a truck and is now in hospital for 2 months.
- ...

Projects can go wrong for many reasons. Try to identify them and your level of responsability in them.

</div>

- **Try to not compare yourself to others**.

<div  style={{"paddingLeft":"1.75rem"}}>
Easier said than done since other are valuable point of comparaison but they tend to be a biased one.

For example, we tend to notice what other knows that we don't. We don't notice what we know that other don't.

</div>

Another example would be a junior member that compars himself to a more experienced member of the team. Sure, you're not as competent, but you cost half as much, and , assuming you didn't lied, they knew it when they hired you.
</div>

- **Don't neglect your hobbies**.

<div  style={{"paddingLeft":"1.75rem"}}>
If you're suffering from imposter syndrome, chance are that you're anxious and you might work more to compensate your (perceived) flaws. That's a very slippery slope to burnout.

Hobbies and exercice are one of the most effective way to prevent burnout. [^5] Keeping a good work-life balance is good for your well-being, but also your productivity. [^6]
