## Overcoming imposter syndrome

If you're suffering from imposter syndrome, there's hope ! You can overcome it with some time. Here are some things that helped me overcome my own: 


* **Challenge your own beliefs**.  

<div  style={{"paddingLeft":"1.75rem"}}>
Imposter syndrome come with certains core beliefs, like *"I'm only here because of luck"* or *"I'm gonna fail some day, and they'll discover my inadequacy"*. They are just thought, and they might both true and false. Try to examine your successes, failures, and feedback from your superior **with an objective perspective** (one effect of imposter syndrome is to discard success). Maybe you're lucky, yes, but maybe you're also comptent.

Tools like [CBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) can be used.
</div>

* **Read about it**.  

<div  style={{"paddingLeft":"1.75rem"}}>
Understanding that it's a widespread psychological phenomen can help put it in perspective. 
</div>

* **Talk about it**.  

<div  style={{"paddingLeft":"1.75rem"}}>
Be it your friends, your co-workers or  your superiors, chances are that, you might know someone that experience(ed) it too. A lot of people experience it in secret.  For example, a friend of mine was also experiencing it to my bewilderment, even though he probably is one of the most skilled engineer I know.
</div>


* **Curb your own exceptations**.

<div  style={{"paddingLeft":"1.75rem"}}>
You won't know everything. You will make mistakes. Both are fine, as long as you continually try to improve yourself. Perfectionism is the most certain way to burnout.
</div>

* **Know your responsabilities**.  

<div  style={{"paddingLeft":"1.75rem"}}>
As long as you didn't lied to get your position, management hired knowing your technical level. Their work is, therefore, to give you task that you can do (within the deadlines they give you).

That means that, If a project is behind schedule, it's probably not (only) your fault:
*	Maybe the time estimation was very optimistic.
*	Maybe some problems arised during developement (using legacy code not architecturally designed for what you want to do now, deprecated libraries, ...) . 
*	Maybe your lead developper got it by a truck and is now in hospital for 2 months. 
*	...

Projects can go wrong for many (external and internal) reasons. Try to identify them (and your level of responsabilty in them). Chances are that you won't be totally responsible. 
</div>


* **Try to not compare yourself to others**.  

<div  style={{"paddingLeft":"1.75rem"}}>
Easier said than done, since other might be a valuable point of comparaison, but that's a very biased one: we tends to remar

# Insert here graph imposter syndrome

For example, if you're a junior, you shouldn't stress yourself because you lack technical skills compared to a more senior member. You certainely do, but you cost at least half as less as a senior. 
</div>

* **Take a break from work**.  

<div  style={{"paddingLeft":"1.75rem"}}>
Again, easier said than done, but it might a way better idea to go for a run than to work that
