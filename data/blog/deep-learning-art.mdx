While browsing aimlessly the Internet, I stumbled on a subreddit named [/r/DeepDream](https://www.reddit.com/r/deepdream/).  

The entire purpose of the subreddit is to promote some machine-learning generated art.  The results are a little bit unexpected and trippy, but always interesting.

Now, this article is going to focus on the VQGAN+CLIP, a text-to-image algorithm capable of generating astonishing art with only a few prompts and tweaking.
